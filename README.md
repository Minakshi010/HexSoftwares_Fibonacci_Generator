)
📌 Project Overview

The Fibonacci Series Generator is a Python-based mini project developed during an internship/academic learning phase. The project demonstrates Python fundamentals such as loops, generators (yield), user input handling, and algorithmic thinking, all based on the mathematical recurrence relationship of the Fibonacci sequence.
